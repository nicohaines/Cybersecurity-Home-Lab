## **Cybersecurity Labs**

This is the starting point for my cybersecurity labs. So far, it includes 2 labs, with more projects to come as I continue building out the environment.

**Table of Contents**

1\. [Linux Command Line and Security Basics](Linux_Command_Line_and_Security_Basics.md)

* *This repository demonstrates an understanding of Linux command-line fundamentals through tasks involving system updates/upgrades, user management, group management, and permissions including Access Control Lists (ACLs).*

2\. [Environment Variable and Set-UID Attack Basics](Environment_Variable_and_Set-UID_Attack_Basics/README.md)

* *This repository demonstrates my understanding of various vulnerabilities, including those related to environment variables, Set-UID programs, capability leaking, dynamic loaders/linkers, and securely invoked external programs. Each example includes accompanying documentation with further explanations.*
